# The most difficult part of the challenge
- is that the designs are in PNG, I should just try my best to guess the measure.
- I'm a bit confused as to how the design should be for tablet size or the size between 375px and 1440px. So, i don't do anything on that.

# The easiest part of the challenge
I think when the component has display flex. Since I love flex and am very familiar on it. So, i found it so easy.
